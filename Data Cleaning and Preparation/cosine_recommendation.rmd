 Objective is to find similarity between institutions so that application can recommend which insitutions are the best fit for a particular student. Students will provide his/her background information and application will find the best fit institution for the student based on cosine similarity.
 
 
Data preperation- Attributes are based on mainly students background, family background, interest of study and cost of study.
The name of the institution and zip code combination are considered as unique key.Cost for the program is selected based on private, public or others. Multiple years of data averaged over unique key.

null values replaced by mean of the field.

```{r}

  trainSummary[,i][is.na(trainSummary[,i])] <- mean(trainSummary[,i], na.rm = TRUE)
}

```
Cosine similarity function 

```{r}
getCosine<-function(x,y)
  {
  this.cosine=sum(x*y)/(sqrt(sum(x*x))*sqrt(sum(y*y)))
  return (this.cosine)
  }

```
Initial testing of the function

```{r}
institution= trainSummary[,1]
trainSum=trainSummary[-c(1)]
insti_916=trainSum[916,]
insti_2=trainSum[2,]
insti_18=trainSum[18,]
test_inst=trainSum[4977,]
getCosine(insti_2,insti_2)
getCosine(insti_2,insti_18)

```
Testing for a average student of 'Yale university'(tested both for the best and the worst match)

```{r}
sim_vec=c()
for (i in 1:nrow(trainSum)){
     sim_vec[i]=getCosine(test_inst,trainSum[i,])
}
res_data=NULL
res_data=data.frame(cbind(institution,sim_vec))

head(res_data[order(-sim_vec),],20)
head(res_data[order(sim_vec),],10)
```

Conclusion-

1) For this particular testing we can found some similar university as 'Yale' but not all.
2) Other relevant fields need to consider.
3) Null value replacement with mean is very simplistic assumption. Need better approach.
4) Need to try other similarity methods, such as Pearson correlation, Euclidean,Bayesian etc.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
